Welcome to my blog. I was using medium, but am beginning to port my content to this site.

<!-- truncate -->

## Reasons for moving

### Making some spare change

The monetization methods on medium are not that great. I want to make my content available and make a few extra pennies than what Medium can offer.

### No more paywall

With monetization on Medium, there are often paywalls which makes it hard to share with my colleagues.

### More practice

Even though this is a static site, it gives me the opportunity to increase my experience with React and front-ends.
